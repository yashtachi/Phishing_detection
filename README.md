## Introduction
This project will provide the identification of phishing and non-phishing websites .Just you have to enter the website link in the text book of the app interface , then you will get the info of the website i.e phishing or not 
## Features

For the identification of the phishing websites I used ```csv``` file of phishing and non-phishing websites and trained a model based on it using python libraries like scikitlearn and sub modules in it and we used matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation of data at each phase of project

## Installation

First install necessary libraries of python . The necesssary libraries are mentioned in our ```requirements.txt``` You just download it and run the below command in your command pannel 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
The csv file of phishing mails is from kaggle ```kaggle.com```

## Usage
The primary use of this project is to protect users from falling victim to phishing attacks. By integrating this project into web browsers or cybersecurity systems, it can provide real-time warnings to users when they attempt to visit a potentially harmful website.

we are  further developing this to make in as a plugin and extension that prevents victims to visit those phishing sites
